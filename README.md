# Christmas Snake Game

This is my second Python game! 🎮

I uploaded the main executable as the release. Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake to eat the food. I’ve added a Christmas theme to the classic Snake game to give it a festive touch! 🎄🐍

## How to Play
- Use the **arrow keys** to move the snake.
- Eat the food to grow the snake.
- Try to avoid running into the walls!

## Release
The game executable is available in the Releases section.

## Enjoy and Happy Holidays! 🎅🎉
